    "text": "# Release Notes\n\n## Version 0.1.0\n\nWe are extremely pleased to announce the release of version 0.1.0 of our software. This version comes with a host of new features, improvements, and fixes. We have significantly expanded our AI security rules, dependency scanning capabilities, and secrets detection to bolster security. We have also integrated a new plugin system and made several enhancements in the configuration and management of plugins. Furthermore, we have improved test coverage and stabilized several features.\n\n### New Features\n\n- **Pre-Commit Hook and CI Checks:** We have included a project-level pre-commit hook with CI-matching checks for rigorous code review prior to commits.\n- **Command Flags:** We introduced `--fmt`, `--vet`, `--lint` flags to the `nox protect install` command to provide more control over its operation.\n- **Dependency Scanning:** OSV vulnerability enrichment has been added to enhance dependency scanning.\n- **Secrets Detection:** The Shannon entropy matcher for high-entropy secret detection is a new feature that improves the identification of potential security threats. We also expanded our secrets detection rules from 5 to 86 with keyword pre-filtering.\n- **Git History Scanning:** The git history commit walker allows for scanning past commits, providing a comprehensive view of the project's history.\n- **Plugin System:** We implemented a robust plugin ecosystem with tracks, profiles, telemetry, scaffolding, and CI workflows. This includes a plugin SDK with gRPC scaffolding and conformance tests, a plugin safety engine for runtime enforcement, and commands for plugin and registry management.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Test Coverage:** We improved our test coverage from 67.6% to 83.1% to ensure reliability.\n- **Configuration:** The `.nox.yaml` scan configuration has been unified for easier management.\n- **Badge Text:** We replaced the badge text with an A-F security grade for a more intuitive understanding of security status.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- **Pre-Commit Hook and Test Fixtures:** We stabilized the pre-commit hook and suppressed test fixture findings to ensure smooth operation.\n- **Annotation and Diff Tests:** We stabilized the annotate and diff tests for the CI environment.\n- **Badge Count:** The badge now counts only active findings to provide a more accurate security status.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **README:** We updated the README with information on the new OSV enrichment, pre-commit hooks, and other new features. We also included a quick demo and comprehensive usage guide.\n\nThis release is the result of comprehensive efforts and dedicated work of our team to bring more efficiency, security, and control to your projects. We invite you to upgrade to version 0.1.0 and experience the new enhancements.\n\n## Changelog\n\n# Changelog\n\n## [0.1.0] - 2022-XX-XX\n\n### Added\n- Project-level pre-commit hook with CI-matching checks.\n- `--fmt`, `--vet`, `--lint` flags to nox protect install.\n- OSV vulnerability enrichment for dependency scanning.\n- Pre-commit hook installer and custom rules CLI.\n- Shannon entropy matcher for high-entropy secret detection.\n- Git history commit walker for scanning past commits.\n- Expanded AI security rules to 18 and IaC rules to 50.\n- Expanded secrets detection from 5 to 86 rules with keyword pre-filtering.\n- Replaced badge text with A-F security grade.\n- Baseline, policy, suppressions, diff, watch, completions, badge, and PR annotations.\n- Test coverage tracking with coverctl and badge.\n- GitHub Action with checksum verification and fix interspersed scan flags.\n- `explain` section to `.nox.yaml` config.\n- `nox show` finding inspector with TUI, MCP tools, and enriched context.\n- Plugin ecosystem with tracks, profiles, telemetry, scaffolding, and CI workflows.\n- Unified `.nox.yaml` scan configuration.\n- Release infrastructure with GoReleaser, Relicta, and Homebrew tap.\n- Open-source community infrastructure.\n- Project name change from Hardline to Nox.\n- Integration of plugin capability discovery into assist module.\n- Agent-assist module with LLM-powered finding explanations.\n- Plugin SDK with gRPC scaffolding and conformance tests.\n- Plugin safety engine runtime enforcement.\n- CLI plugin and registry management commands.\n- OCI artifact distribution with content-addressed cache.\n- Plugin trust and verification layer.\n- Plugin registry client with semver resolution and caching.\n- Bridging of MCP server to plugin host for agent-accessible plugin tools.\n- Plugin host runtime with safety policy and type conversion.\n- Protobuf plugin interface with gRPC service contract.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved test coverage from 67.6% to 83.1%.\n\n### Fixed\n- Stabilized pre-commit hook and suppressed test fixture findings.\n- Stabilized annotate and diff tests for CI environment.\n- Fixed index-based range to avoid rangeValCopy lint error.\n- Badge now counts only active findings and logo restored in README.\n- Eliminated false positives in self-scan and pinned GitHub Actions.\n- Binary files are now skipped in the scanner and added per-severity badges.\n- RuleSet is now passed to SARIF reporter so help text appears in Code Scanning.\n- Applied gofmt to SARIF struct alignment.\n- Added help, fullDescription, and helpUri to SARIF rule catalog.\n- Fixed index-based range loops to avoid rangeValCopy lint errors.\n- Applied gofmt to badge grade thresholds.\n- Resolved CI lint errors and made coverctl install non-blocking.\n- Security badge added to README and fixed plugin-release workflow.\n- Suppressed findings are now excluded from badge, diff, and watch counts.\n- Extraction now only for known top-level flags in interspersed arg parser.\n- Added timeout to `nox explain` to prevent indefinite hangs.\n- Interspersed flags and positional args are now allowed in `nox show`.\n\n### Deprecated\n- None.\n\n### Removed\n- None.\n\n### Security\n- None.\n\n### Documentation\n- Updated README with OSV enrichment, pre-commit hooks, and new features.\n- Rewritten README with quick demo and added comprehensive usage guide.\n- Added plugin system backlog items and extension architecture guide.\n\n### Other\n- Updated security badges [skip ci].\n- Updated roady plan and backlog with new features.\n- Fixed golangci-lint config, applied gofmt, and improved CI workflow.\n- Added explanations.json to .gitignore.\n- Updated roady state for completed tasks.",
